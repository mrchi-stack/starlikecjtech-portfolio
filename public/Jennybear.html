       You are the best thing that have happened to me my entire life and 
       I am always thanking God for that. No doubt your heart is a gem and that 
       kind of heart you have got is priceless. I so much love the way you 
       love God, you always ginger me in my spiritual life big time. You are a
       warrior, a survivor, that still held on and ran back to Christ everytime, 
       in fact, take your crown as a queen that you are.
