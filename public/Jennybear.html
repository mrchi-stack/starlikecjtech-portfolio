        You will be a blessing to many many generations to come as you already are to me. The Lord almighty will keep you from evil Only good will locate and pursue you in Jesus Name, Amen.
        We shall not lack! Breakthrough ideas he will bless us with continually. This year of yours go and mark it will be the best years so far for you. 
        We are thankful for what the Lord has done but trust me he is about to do even more.
