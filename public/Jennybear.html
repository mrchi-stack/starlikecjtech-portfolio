      <p>Hurrayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!! It's my favorite, cutest, most amazing person's birthday 🥰. Where do I even begin from to talk about the goodness of God (you) in my life?</p>
      <p>Let me start with I love you so much and you know that and I know you love me the same. Relationship is one crazy ride but I am thankful we are both doing it with Christ at the center.

        I want to pray for you from the depth of my heart today that the Lord will cause your face to shine upon the Earth. People will see you you and thank God for God in your life.
        You will be a blessing to many many generations to come as you already are to me. The Lord almighty will keep you from evil. Only good will locate and pursue you in Jesus Name, Amen.
        We shall not lack! Breakthrough ideas he will bless us with continually. This year of yours go and mark it, it will be the best year for you. 🙏
        We are thankful for what the Lord has done but trust me he is about to do even more.
      </p>

         But wait before I leave ehhn, Jennybear do me a favor. Help me get this to Mama and Pops. Dont be scared. 🙂
         Mama and Pops, this David, Jennybear is the love of my life. Although this message might not get to you cause Jennybear might not send it but atleast I still tried.
         I am using this opportunity to say thank you for how you have sheltered her like your own. From the depth of my heart I pray may the good Lord reward you immensely🙏.
         For now this is my way of saying thank you (writing this epistle)
         via web dev. I know a time is coming that I will say thank you even more substantially.
